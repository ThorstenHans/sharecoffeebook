# Getting Started

Enough dry background and information about ShareCoffee, let's get started using it. Within the upcoming sections you'll learn how to build a simple *Hello World SharePoint App*. Once the Hello World App is finished you'll get an introduction into the *ShareCoffee.Common* namespace, which is the actual core of ShareCoffee. Almost every additional feature is built on top of ShareCoffee.Commons. It's important to understand all the concepts and functionality which is built in the framework to be as productive as possible when building SharePoint Apps.

## Package Managers

Package Managers are great time savers for every developer. ShareCoffee is available for

 * [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org)
 * [Bower.IO](http://bower.io)

At the time ShareCoffee has been created, these were the most popular and well-known package managers out there. Every .NET developer should know NuGet, if you don't know it yet, you should read [Scott Hanselman's NuGet introduction](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingNuGetPackageManagementForNETAnotherPieceOfTheWebStack.aspx) first.

Bower.IO introduces itself as package manager for the client-side. Which implies that bower is only managing client-side dependencies. Bower became popular with the rise of [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org) and [yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

### Installing ShareCoffee with NuGet

Installing ShareCoffee using NuGet is really simple. Just invoke the *Install-Package* command from the Package Manager Console, or use the Package Manager Dialogs provided by Visual Studio.

    Install-Package ShareCoffee

### Installing ShareCoffee with bower.io

First let's asume that *NodeJS* and *npm* (Node Package Manager) are installed on your development system. If that's true, you can install bower package manager by invoking

    # use g switch to install bower globally
    npm install bower -g

    # on unix based systems you've to prefix the command with sudo, which ensures that you've the required permissions
    sudo npm install bower -g

    # At this point you should have bower installed on your system.
    # Go into your project directory and execute the following command to install 
    # ShareCoffee form the bower.io dictionary

    bower install sharecoffee

Bower offers exactly the same capabilities as NuGet like updating, downgrading, uninstalling dependencies. ShareCoffee is offering it's package also on bower.io in order to support SharePoint App developers that use NodeJS or RubyOnRails for building their Apps, because bower.io is more popular in their communities.

## Hello ShareCoffee

### Your first SharePoint App with ShareCoffee

There isn't a better way to get started with a framework as actually using it.

  * Start **Visual Studio 2013** by using the **Run as administrator** option
  * Create a new project using FILE | NEW | PROJECT
  * From the **New Project** dialog choose VISUAL C# | OFFICE/SHAREPOINT and select **App for SharePoint**
  * Provide **HelloShareCoffee** as name and hit **OK**
  * In **SharePoint App wizard** provide your **Developer-Site's url**

T> ## SharePoint App Hosting Options
T> All the different hosting options were discussed in Chapter One, if you're not using the recent VS 2013 Update (Update 3) you may see the term Autohosted App right here. Autohosted Apps are depricated, so currently there are only two real options. 
T> If you've already created Autohosted Apps for SharePoint read [this article for more inforation](http://blogs.office.com/2014/05/16/update-on-autohosted-apps-preview-program/)

For this sample lets choose **SharePoint-Hosted** as type of the App and click **Finish**. Depending on your system configuration, you've to provide your Office 365 credentials now in order to access the Developer Site. After providing them, Visual Studio is going to spin up the project.

Open the **Package Manager Console** by focusing the VS2013's new **Quick Launch** and start typing **Package Manager Console**. From the list of results select **View -> Other Windows -> Package Manager Console**

![Visual Studio 2013's Quick Launch](images/GettingStarted/quicklaunch.png)

In the Package Manage console type

    Install-Package ShareCoffee

At this point ShareCoffee will be installed into your App project (revisit the Scripts Folder).

### Updating Default.aspx

Default.aspx is responsible for actually presenting your App and it's the page that will be shown when an user clicks on your App-Tile.

You can find the Default.aspx underneath **Pages** open it by double-clicking it. Look for a comment like this

    <!-- Add your JavaScript to the following file -->

Load ShareCoffee right here by referencing the minified ShareCoffee JavaScript file

    <script type="text/javascript" 
            src="../Scripts/ShareCoffee/ShareCoffee.min.js">
    </script>

Within the **PlaceHolderMain Content Control** remove all the content and replace it with the following HTML

{title="Hello World UI",lang=html}
~~~~~~
    <h1>Hello ShareCoffee</h1>
    <h4> AppWeb Url:
      <span id="appWebUrl"></span>
    </h4>
    <h4> HostWeb Url:
      <span id="hostWebUrl"></span>
    </h4>
    <h4> API Root Url:
      <span id="apiRootUrl"></span>
    </h4>
    <h4> Form Digest:
      <span id="formDigest"></span>
    </h4>
~~~~~~

### Updating App.js

Finally the JavaScript logic has to be changed, open the App.js file by double-clicking it. (It's located in the Scripts folder). Delete **all the content** from the JavaScript file and write the following few lines of JavaScript code.

{title="Hello World logic",lang=javascript}
~~~~~~
    $(document).ready(function() {

      $("#appWebUrl").text(ShareCoffee.Commons.getAppWebUrl());
      $("#hostWebUrl").text(ShareCoffee.Commons.getHostWebUrl());
      
      $("#apiRootUrl").text(ShareCoffee.Commons.getApiRootUrl());
      $("#formDigest").text(ShareCoffee.Commons.getFormDigest());
    });
~~~~~~

The script is really straight forward. It's piping the result values from ShareCoffee's methods directly to each span's **text** method.

### Testing the App

 Install and test your SharePoint-Hosted App by hitting **F5** in Visual Studio. Visual Studio will now package your SharePoint App. Once packaging is finished, the App package will be uploaded and installed in your Office 365 Developer Site using a technology called **Side Loading**.

 Your default browser should now popup and load your App's start-page. If you've followed all the steps described above, your browser should present something similar to this
