Thorsten Hans is currently working together with four fellow SharePoint MVP's for [Experts Inside](http://www.expertsinside.com). Experts Inside is a typical StartUp in the age of Web2.0 with distributed offices, no on-premises systems, everything they need comes from the cloud (Office 365 and Windows Azure). He's a passionate developer and most time of the week he is building Apps and Solutions for SharePoint or SharePoint Online. 

Thorsten became a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) from Microsoft since 2011 because of his community contributions. He started blogging back in 2005 and moved his blog in the beginning of 2007 to [dotnet-forum.de](http://dotnet-forum.de/blogs/thorstenhans/) where he published more than 300 posts only focusing on .NET and SharePoint development(in German). 

Since December 2012 he's writing in English on [dotnet-rocks.com](http://www.dotnet-rocks.com). If you're interested in code visit his [github profile](https://github.com/ThorstenHans) or follow him on Twitter **@ThorstenHans**
