#Who Should Read This Book

This book is aimed at a professional programmer, someone who has already written Apps or SharePoint Solutions. Although this book is focused on ShareCoffee and its API, some of the SharePoint App fundamentals and building blocks are described in the beginning.

Everything described in this book can of course be achieved using the regular SharePoint App development stack provided by Microsoft itself. But after reading this book you'll be able to build Apps in a shorter timeframe and focus more on actual requirements than on technical pitfalls.

SharePoint's APIs are finally using web-standards, so every web-developer should be able to build SharePoint Apps using for example the REST API. This book will not provide an introduction for REST and HTTP. If you're not familiar with REST and HTTP you should consider reading an introduction on those topics before digging deeper in ShareCoffee.

When it comes to SharePoint REST API it's important to know some of the SharePoint fundamentals. SharePoint is offering a flexible API, which will reflect data sitting in SharePoint's lists and libraries for example. Those lists and libraries can easily be created, changed or deleted by users with sufficient permissions. Those changes will be directly reflected by the REST API. If you're not familiar with those mechanisms you should also consider reading an introduction on SharePoint's core capabilities.
